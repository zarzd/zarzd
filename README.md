# Hi, I'm Vlad ðŸ‘‹
With over 3 years of experience in Information Technologies and more than 1 year in Data Science
and Machine Learning, I possess a solid understanding of Machine Learning principles, including
supervised and unsupervised learning, classification, regression, and clustering algorithms. I am
familiar with Deep Learning architectures such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and their applications in areas like computer vision and natural
language processing. I have knowledge of data preprocessing techniques, feature engineering, model
selection, and evaluation metrics.

### My opensource projects

*   [Neural Network from scratch](https://github.com/zarzd/Neural_Network) - Designed and implemented a neural network framework from scratch, including forward and backward
propagation, various activation functions, and optimization algorithms, to enhance understanding of
neural network mechanics and gain practical implementation experience.
*   [Face mood recognition](https://github.com/zarzd/mood_recognition) - Developed a facial emotion recognition system using TensorFlow. Preprocessed a dataset of facial images
with annotated emotions. Built and trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract features
and classify emotions, leveraging transfer learning and fine-tuning techniques for improved accuracy.
*   [Flood Prediction Competition on Kaggle](https://github.com/zarzd/ML_competitions/tree/main/Flood_prediction) - I participated in the Flood Prediction Competition on Kaggle, applying machine learning techniques to predict the probability of flooding using historical weather data, terrain features, and other factors. I utilized data exploration, cleaning, and feature engineering to extract meaningful insights and enhance model performance. This experience honed my skills in working with real-world data, applying advanced machine learning techniques, and contributing to a critical societal issue - flood prediction.
